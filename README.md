## Build On The Internet. No Dependencies.

The Internet Computer extends the public Internet so it can natively host
websites, software systems, open internet services and DeFi. It is created by
independent data centers worldwide running the ICP protocol.

## What are we building

The Policy of the Future is Made by All of Us. We ([get.impact.now][gin]) is
building a digital Platform which enables responsible Citizen to Be Part of the
Decision-Making Process.

As such a Platform must not be controlled by any central party, we'll build it
on the natural evolution of the internet called the Internet Computer (IC). The
IC is build by a [Foundation called DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/foundation):

DFINITYs mission is:

> ... to build The Internet Computer, thereby reinventing the Internet as a
> computer that hosts secure software with superpowers. The Internet Computer is
> a new technology stack that is unhackable, fast, scales to billions of users
> around the world, and supports a new kind of autonomous software that promises
> to reverse Big Tech’s monopolization of the internet.
